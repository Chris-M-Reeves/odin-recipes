        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>A cheeseburger is a classic comfort food made with a juicy, seasoned beef patty topped with melted cheese. The cheese drapes over the edges of the patty, adding a rich, creamy layer that blends perfectly with the savory flavors of the meat. Nestled in a soft, golden bun, the burger is often garnished with fresh lettuce, a thick slice of ripe tomato, and a few tangy pickles to bring a refreshing contrast.</p>
        <p>Each bite offers a satisfying blend of textures: the warm, savory beef, the gooey melted cheese, and the cool crunch of crisp toppings. Ketchup, mustard, or a favorite sauce add an extra hint of flavor, making every cheeseburger easily customizable and endlessly enjoyable. Simple yet irresistible, this handheld favorite captures the essence of a hearty, flavorful meal.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 lb ground beef (80/20 for best flavor)</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper, to taste</li>
            <li>4 slices of cheese (American, cheddar, or Swiss)</li>
            <li>4 burger buns</li>
            <li>Lettuce leaves</li>
            <li>1 large tomato, sliced</li>
            <li>Dill pickles, sliced</li>
            <li>Ketchup, mustard, or favorite sauce (optional)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Method</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Prepare the patties:</strong> Shape the ground beef into 4 equal-sized patties, making a small indentation in the center of each to prevent them from puffing up while cooking. Season both sides with salt and pepper.</li>
            <li><strong>Cook the patties:</strong> Heat a grill or skillet over medium-high heat. Cook the patties for about 3-4 minutes per side, or until they reach your desired level of doneness. During the last minute of cooking, place a slice of cheese on each patty and cover with a lid to melt.</li>
            <li><strong>Toast the buns:</strong> While the patties cook, toast the burger buns lightly on the grill or in a separate pan until golden brown.</li>
            <li><strong>Assemble the burgers:</strong> Place the cooked patties with melted cheese on the bottom half of each bun. Top with lettuce, tomato slices, and pickles. Add ketchup, mustard, or your favorite sauce if desired.</li>
            <li><strong>Serve:</strong> Place the top bun on the assembled ingredients and serve immediately. Enjoy your delicious cheeseburger!</li>
